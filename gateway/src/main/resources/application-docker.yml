# Docker profile configuration for Gateway

# EDUCATIONAL NOTE - Spring Profiles
#
# When running in Docker, we need to use service names instead of localhost.
# Docker Compose creates a network where services can reach each other by name.

# This file overrides the default application.yml when SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
